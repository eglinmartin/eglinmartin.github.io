				<p> I am Martin - a postgraduate student at the University of Leeds, studying Geographical Information Systems (GIS) in the school of Geography. </p>
				<p> At Leeds I started out focussing on GIS packages (ArcGIS, QGIS, MapInfo), but by the second half of the year, I had gravitated considerably towards programming both GIS software and web GIS packages. </p>
				<p> This website has been made from scratch using HTML and CSS, to demonstrate the work that I have done this year.  Much of this has been self-taught, both due to the surge of COVID-19 and my own choice of subjects for optional modules. </p>

								<h1> National EPC Rating Visualizer </h1>
								<p> An extension of a previous project of mine, this program used the pandas/geopandas python library to spatially aggregate EPC (Energy Performance Rating) data and display it using clipped GIS shapefiles of the United Kingdom, refined by administrative district.  Such a program allows the user to easily see the spatial distribution of the UK's energy efficiency, in the hopes that this would assist policy targeting for renewable projects and retrofitting initiatives. </p>

								<h1> Belfast Urban Tree Webmap </h1>
								<p> A more detailed mapping web tool, this time using the open-source Leaflet API, that maps all urban trees in Belfast, to allow for more efficient documentation of their condition and to show areas with fewer trees.  Trees are stored in an SQL database, which may be appended with more data using a form, that has been protected from SQL insertion attacks. </p>
								<p> NOTE: Although the website is available, the SQL database is stored on the University of Leeds' servers, and therefore no information will appear on the map itself, nor will the form work as intended. </p>

								<h1> Wind Turbine Model </h1>
								<p> Assignment 2 of 2 for the GEOG5990M programming course at Leeds University.  This program performs a simple multi-criteria analysis of the ocean floor to identify areas suitable for wind turbines. </p>
								<p> The user may establish the parameters (minimum and maximum depth and slope), as well as both the number of turbines required and the minimum distance between them.  The model runs a raster multi-criteria analysis of the ocean floor based on these parameters, clips it to only suitable land surfaces, and places a number of wind turbines in random locations.  All interactivity is performed in a graphical user interface (GUI), with the program completely independent from the IDE it was developed in. </p>

								<h1> Sheep Model </h1>
								<p> Assignment 1 of 2 for the GEOG5990M programming course at Leeds University.  This agent-based project models the movement of sheep through a field whilst consuming grass and avoiding wolves.
								<p> This model recreates the movement of sheep through a field. The sheep move in random directions at a constant speed through the field. Wolves patrol the field at varying speeds in random directions, and eat sheep if within a distance from them. The farmer(s) stays within the fence, shooting wolves if they come near enough to them. If sheep move within the fence, they become 'owned' by the farmer, who shears them (turning them pink), and their movement is restricted to inside the fence. </p>
