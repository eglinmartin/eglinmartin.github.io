	<p style = "font-family:arial;"> This model recreates the movement of sheep through a field.  The sheep move in random directions at a constant speed through the field.  Wolves patrol the field at varying speeds in random directions, and eat sheep if within a distance from them.  The farmer(s) stays within the fence, shooting wolves if they come near enough to them.  If sheep move within the fence, they become 'owned' by the farmer, who shears them (turning them pink), and their movement is restricted to inside the fence.
